# Class Commenting Practices in Pharo

# Abstract
Previous studies have characterised code comments in different programming languages, and  have shown
how a high quality of code comments is crucial to support program comprehension activities and to improve the effectiveness of maintenance tasks.
However, (i) very few studies have focused on the analysis of the information embedded in class comments, and (ii) none of them have analyzed these characteristics in the Pharo Smalltalk environment.
       
This paper reports the first empirical study investigating class comments and commenting practices in Pharo.
Results of this study show that there is a steady increase in class commenting over time, and that developers frequently add comments to old classes in Pharo.
In addition, the analysis of the semantics of the comments from the latest Pharo version suggests that  23 information types are typically embedded in class comments by developers, and that only 7 of them are present in the latest Pharo class comment template.
As a consequence, the current class comment template substantially diverges from the contemporary commenting practices of developers,  suggesting the need for new Pharo templates integrating the missing information types, to ensure a higher quality of class comments.
